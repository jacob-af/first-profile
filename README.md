# My Profile Page


## About this page
This is my first profile page, using Bootstrap with minimal additional CSS for styling. I tried my best to keep a simple and clean design, taking advantage of the built in power of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

## Features

I had fun making a responsive design with a drop down navbar at smaller widths, adding a slight animation to the branding of my name, importing [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as well as icons from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/start).
